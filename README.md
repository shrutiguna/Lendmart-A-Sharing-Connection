3. **Screen** folder includes all the different pages of the app.
4. **Navigation** folder handles the app's navigation setup, including Stack Navigation and Tab Navigation.
5. **assets** folder contains default media files like icons and images used within the app.
6. **Components** folder stores reusable components, such as those used for displaying product information.
7. **Constants** folder holds fixed values, including color codes (in hexadecimal format) used consistently across the app.
